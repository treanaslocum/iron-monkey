        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">How much does a website cost?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">Every website is built to meet the needs of the individual customer; therefore, the cost of a new website will vary depending on how many pages and features you require. However, we provide honest pricing, and are happy to tailor packages to fit your budget. As a starting point a website from Iron Monkey starts at $800.</p>

        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">Do I need a website?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">In our opinion, yes, every business should have a website. It's important to note that 70-80% of potential customers could be lost to businesses without a website. And roughly 85% of consumers use the internet to discover and find local businesses. It's also important to keep in focus that a website is your virtual representation of your business. It allows you to showcase your products or services to the world. Now, while it is still possible to find customers without one, the absence of a secure, professional website can damage consumer confidence and make prospective customers question your credibility. So whether you are looking to establish a firm online presence, or simply tick that box for your customers, we can help.</p>

        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">Why hire a professional web designer?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">Amateur web design may look acceptable on the surface, but sites are often riddled with broken links, load slowly, and are likely to look terrible on smaller screens. This can be far more costly than hiring a web designer as your potential customers may look elsewhere for a better experience. User experience and conversion are tightly linked, and we offer affordable designs that will ensure your visitors stick around.</p>

      <div class="mt-8">
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">How long will it take to complete my website?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">Our standard timeline is 1-2 weeks for simpler sites, but for more robust sites it can take from 3-6 weeks to complete. It all depends on the project since the size and pace of any project differs depending on each client we work with. How much input you can provide during the initial stages, your feedback, how soon the content is provided – all this affects the speed of completion. The functionality and revisions required will also play a role in your timeline.</p>

      <div class="mt-8">
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">Do I have to be in Vegas to work with you?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">No! We have clients all over the world and communicate with them over email and Zoom.</p>
      </div>
       <div class="mt-8">
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">What if I don't have photos for my website?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">For the images on your website, we will assist you in finding high quality photography from either free stock libraries, or even premium paid photo libraries. Your direction will be needed to find the best images to suit your business.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-8">
        <p class="text-xl w-2/3 font-semibold">Do you provide a domain name and web hosting?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">No. You will be responsible for your website domain name and hosting. This allows you to retain full control over over the domain and website files if you ever decide to move. We can recommend some reliable website hosts and will complete the new website migration for you so the process is still very easy for you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="mt-8">
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">Will my website be secure?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">Yes, we ensure all websites we produce are launched with an SSL certificate, identifiable by the little padlock in the URL bar. Your digital security is top priority, and is also reassuring for your customers, so we never send out a website without one.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="mt-8">
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">Is SEO included with my website?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">No, the development of your website doe not include monthly SEO. All content (images, text and videos) will be seen by Google but does not mean your website will rank number 1. To increase your organic search position on Google, we recommend monthly SEO services from a team of professionals.</p>

      <div class="mt-8">
        <p class="text-xl font-semibold">Who writes the website text?</p>
        <p class="w-5/6">We encourage that you write and supply all of the text that you want on the website. After all, you know your business best. If you need some support with this task we can supply a copywriter for you to rework your copy, or create original content at $25 per hour.</p>
